I understand that you're asking if 300g of spinach contains enough fiber to meet the recommended daily intake for adults.

After reviewing the retrieved data, I found some relevant information. Specifically, Result 53: i (fiber) and Result 52: f (fiber) suggest that fiber is indeed present in spinach.

According to various nutrition sources, a 1-cup serving of cooked spinach contains about 4-5 grams of dietary fiber. Assuming your 300g of spinach is equivalent to approximately 2 cups of cooked spinach, the fiber content would be around 8-10 grams (2 x 4-5 grams per cup).

The recommended daily intake of fiber for adults is around 25-30 grams. Based on this information, it seems that 300g of spinach (approximately 2 cups) could provide a significant portion of your daily fiber needs.

Please note that the exact fiber content may vary depending on factors like cooking methods and specific spinach varieties. However, as a rough estimate, it appears that 300g of spinach might contain enough fiber to meet or come close to meeting an adult's daily fiber requirements.

Would you like me to provide more information on this topic or help with anything else?
