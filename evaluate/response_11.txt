I see we're exploring the fascinating world of fatty acids! There are many sources of fatty acids beyond fish, and I'd be happy to guide you through some of them. Here are a few examples:

1. **Nuts and seeds**: Many nuts and seeds are rich in healthy fats, such as:
	* Almonds (oleic acid)
	* Walnuts (alpha-linolenic acid)
	* Chia seeds (ALA and DHA)
	* Flaxseeds (ALA)
	* Hemp seeds (GLA)
2. **Avocados**: Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid.
3. **Olive oil**: Olive oil is a great source of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid.
4. **Coconut products**: Coconut oil and coconut milk contain medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which have unique fatty acid profiles.
5. **Grass-fed beef**: Grass-fed beef can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
6. **Eggs**: Eggs from pasture-raised hens may contain omega-3 fatty acids, especially ALA.
7. **Flaxseed oil**: Flaxseed oil is a rich source of ALA.
8. **Walnut oil**: Walnut oil is a good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
9. **Sesame oil**: Sesame oil contains a unique fatty acid called sesamin, which may have health benefits.
10. **Fatty fruits**: Some fruits, like olives and avocados, contain significant amounts of healthy fats.

Remember that while these sources can provide important fatty acids, it's essential to maintain a balanced diet with a variety of whole foods. If you have specific dietary needs or concerns, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized guidance.
