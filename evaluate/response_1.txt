A great question!

As an intelligent agent, I can provide you with some general guidance on calculating your daily calorie needs.

The recommended daily intake of calories varies based on factors such as age, sex, weight, height, and activity level. Here's a simple formula to estimate your daily calorie needs:

1. For women:
	* Sedentary (little or no exercise): 1,800-2,000 calories/day
	* Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): 2,000-2,200 calories/day
	* Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): 2,200-2,400 calories/day
	* Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): 2,400-2,800 calories/day
	* Extremely active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training): 2,800-3,000 calories/day
2. For men:
	* Sedentary: 2,000-2,200 calories/day
	* Lightly active: 2,200-2,400 calories/day
	* Moderately active: 2,400-2,600 calories/day
	* Very active: 2,600-3,000 calories/day
	* Extremely active: 3,000-3,500 calories/day

Keep in mind that these are general estimates and may vary based on individual factors such as your current weight, height, age, and overall health.

For a more accurate calculation, you can use online calorie calculators or consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian. They can help you determine a personalized daily calorie intake based on your specific needs and goals.

Remember, it's essential to maintain a balanced diet and adjust your calorie intake accordingly to support your weight management and overall health goals!
